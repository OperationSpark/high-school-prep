# Required Accounts

##Google

Firstly, you MUST signup for a Google Account, and you must remember your Google username and password.

https://accounts.google.com/signup

A Google account gives you access to great, free email. The Google platform gives you access to productivity tools, like documents and spreadsheets. There's also free file storage through Google Drive. Your Google account also is your passport to YouTube, and other third party platforms.

Pick a professional username! If you already have one, **make sure your username is professional!** Do not use an email address like:

flyboygmoney@gmail.com

The idea here is to remain as neutral as possible in your professional communication. For your Google username, you should use your real name, first and last:

gracejones@gmail.com

If your first and last name are taken, try adding a postfix, something semantic like the short form for your city of birth:

gracejonesnola@gmail.com

This will be meaningful to other people, whereas gracejones2993@gmail.com is less so.

##GitHub

Students need a GitHub account and will need to remember their GitHub username and password.

GitHub is a place on the Internet where we can store code! It's a cool social coding platform, kind of like Facebook for coders.

Click on the following link to create a GitHub account. Remember, be professional when choosing a username. Try to use the same username you used for Google.
