# Advice on Creating Usernames and Passwords

**Usernames**

It's best to represent ourselves in a professional manner on the Internet. Your username might provide evaluation for potential employers. Given this, it's best to create a username that is neutral.

Certain names are fine for use between you and your friends. But, names like flyboygmoney@gmail.com may not be appropriate for professional representation. 

Again, the idea here is to remain as neutral as possible in your professional communication.  For your Google username, you should use your real name, first and last:

rikiajones@gmail.com

If your first and last name are in use, try adding a postfix, something short, like the short-form for your city of birth:

rikiajonesnola@gmail.com

For consistency, once you have a username for a Google account, try to use the same username on other platforms.

**Passwords**

Strong passwords are advisable. Do not use full words or details of your name, address or birthdate. Passwords using these types of words are easier to crack.

The best approach is to create a passphrase. A passphrase is a phrase that is meaningful to you, like the first stanza of lyrics from your favorite song.

To create a password from a passphrase, take the first letter from each word in the phrase. You can capitalize some of them in some pattern, like, capitalize the first and the last letter, or the first and the third.

Random letters and numbers make for stronger passwords.  If you use a passphrase, you'll be able to remember your password more readily.

REMEMBER your passwords, and it's easier to do so if you use a passphrase!
