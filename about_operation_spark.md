Operation Spark offers the quickest path to employment as a software engineer. You can go from High School to High Wage in less than six months! Here's how our programming works:

* **Prep:** The Prep program is the first phase of Operation Spark journey. There are several sets of coding exercises and projects to complete, and in doing so, you'll acquire the skills to move forward onto our intensive coding Bootcamp.

    You can complete Prep program on any Internet connected computer, whether at home, at school, or at the library. You and your teacher and fellow students can form a software club, and together work on the Prep material.

* **Bootcamp:** (Prerequisites : Prep) Our one-month coding Bootcamp is a deep dive into JavaScript.  The course focus on basic programming concepts, functional programming, and basic web development. Students qualify for Bootcamp once they've fully completed the Prep program material and passed the Bootcamp entrance coding quiz.

    Bootcamp prepares students for entry into both our Jr Ready and or our three month, Immersion program.

    * 3 hours a day, 5 days a week for 4 weeks.
