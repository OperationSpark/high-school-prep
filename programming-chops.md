# Prep Assignments 

If you want to write cool apps and games, you've got to learn to write some code! In this section, we're going to get your coding chops up to speed by learning some JavaScript. We'll also build some web projects. The following assignments are pre-requisites for the Fundamentals to Software Development Course:

* Build You Own Website (1-3 hours) 
* Code Camp (8-10 hours) 
* Code Academy - Intro To Java Script (5-6 hours) 

Students can work on the following assignments at school, home, or in the Operation Spark offices. Remember to reference the study guide and take notes on key terms when working through these assignments. Following completion of Prep work, students  sign up for an interview and  quiz before enrolling in the Fundamentals of Software Development course. 

All Prep requirements must be complete by September 16, 2016 in order to enroll in the Fundamentals of Software Development course for the fall semester.
