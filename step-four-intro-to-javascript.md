# Step 4 : Intro to JavaScript

JavaScript is the programming language of the Internet. If you're going to become a software developer, you'll need to learn JavaScript.

We can use JavaScript to build [dynamic websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page), [cool mobile apps](http://ionicframework.com/), and [awesome video games](http://www.phaser.io/).

Let's get you up and running with JavaSript!

**Using your Google account**, sign in to [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/login?continue=%2Fcomputing%2Fcomputer-programming%2Fprogramming#).
