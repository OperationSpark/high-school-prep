# Rock the Interview and Quiz

To move on to Fundamentals of Software Development, students must join us for an interview and complete a quiz.

Once you've fully completed all previous steps, you qualify to take the end-of-prep quiz. Arrange with Operation Spark to take the end-of-prep coding quiz.

You will take the quiz in person at Operation Spark.


## Take Away

Below are the concepts you should come away with and on which you’ll be quizzed.  **You will want to make notes on these items as you go through the Prep material and ENSURE you understand them.**  If you’re fuzzy on some points, Googling is the best way to figure it out.  Self-directed learning and research is the BEST way to solve micro-problems when attacking complex problems in software development, so you should early on practice and develop the reflex to Google-it!

Finally, we have more reading resources online at Operation Spark that cover all topics addressed.  See the table of contents for this material, here:

### Study Guide:


1. What are [variables](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp)? How do we define them and why do we use them?
2. What are some of the basic built-in [data types](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp)? By data types, we mean, types of things - the things you use in your app.
3. What is a [String](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp)? How do we often use them?
4. What is a [Boolean](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_booleans.asp)? When would we use a Boolean?
5. What is an [Array](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp), why do we use them, how do we access their elements, and what is the syntax for creating a literal Array?
6. What is an [Object](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_definition.asp), how do they differ from Arrays, how do we access their values, and what is the syntax for creating a literal Object?
7. What is a [conditional statement](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp) (if statement). Why do we use them and what is the syntax for creating one?
8. What is a [loop](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp), why do we use loops, and, naming one, what is the syntax for creating that loop?
9. What is a [function](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp), how do we define a function, how do we call (or execute) a function, and what do we use them?  What are parameters and what is a return value?
