# Your Own Website

You're now ready to create your own website!

Complete the first website project and ensure you've published it to the web via GitHub.

The website project is part one of a set of projects that will help you build your own website and projects portfolio. We will be building on this project later in the Operation Spark program. You're going to published your website live on the Internet, so you can send your friends and family to see your awesome work!
