# Step 1 : Get Started

The first thing we will cover is some basic understanding of the Internet and general web development. To start, we'll be using Khan Academy, which hosts a set of awesome videos and exercises on programming topics.

[Use your **take away** notes page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5rlBHHKQIjQ7OMvwpTEQsgWWSZPIAUMwUB0J0U8tjE/edit?usp=sharing), and when you come across topics in the videos listed in the take away, take notes. You must watch each video and complete any exercises. We will check your work.
