# Step 1 : Get Started

The first thing we will cover is some basic understanding of the Internet and general web development. To start, we'll be using Khan Academy, which hosts a set of awesome videos and exercises on programming topics.

[Print out your **take away** notes page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5rlBHHKQIjQ7OMvwpTEQsgWWSZPIAUMwUB0J0U8tjE/edit?usp=sharing), and when you come across topics in the videos that relate, take notes. You must watch each video and complete any exercises. We will check your work.

Ensure you joined our Khan Academy classroom. If you've yet to do so, review the section, Required Accounts. **Make sure you login to Khan Academy with using your gmail account _before_ starting this work. If you don't, you will lose your progress!**
