# Step 1 : Get Started

The first thing we will cover is some basic understanding of the Internet and general web development. To start, we'll be using Khan Academy, which hosts a set of awesome videos and exercises on programming topics. Don't underestimate the value of these videos

[Print out your **take away** notes page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5rlBHHKQIjQ7OMvwpTEQsgWWSZPIAUMwUB0J0U8tjE/edit?usp=sharing), and when you come across topics in the videos that relate, take notes. You must watch all videos and complete all projects.

To keep track your progress, we need to get you set-up in our classroom at Khan Academy:
