# Step 1 : Get Started

If you want to build awesome websites, video games and learn to code, start a software club at your school! Challenge each other to finish each step. Who will finish first? Host a competition - who has the best website?

Here's some tips to get you started:

* Enlist one of your teachers to help you organize your club.
* Meet at least twice a week, maybe three times, or if you're serious, everyday.
* Work from the classroom, library, and home!
* Rock out the steps!
* Don't stop coding! Never stop coding! Build things! Build all the things!
