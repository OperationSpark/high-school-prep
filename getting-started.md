# Getting Started

First, we're going to create some required Internet accounts at Google and GitHub. Second, we'll cover a basic understanding of the Internet. Finally, we'll dig into an intro to HTML and CSS. 

We'll be using Khan Academy, which hosts a set of awesome videos and exercises on programming topics.
