## Prep

The Prep program will introduce you to what life is like as a professional software developer. It is also designed to prepare you to take the next step in our training, which is why we called the program, Prep!

We want everyone to try their hand at software development! If you like this material, there's a fantastic career waiting for you in software engineering!

### Next Steps
