* (5 hours) [Basic JavaScript](http://www.freecodecamp.com/map#basic-javascript)

##3. Rock Star

**You are not required to complete this Rock Star section**. Still, if you've come this far, why stop learning now?

Many Operation Spark students completed sections 1 through 7 of Free Code Camp. Some completed the whole program! They found these exercises helpful. 

If you're serious about learning, you'll have no problem completing sections 1 through 7. Take the time over a semester to rock it out. Continuing to hack away by building something is the best way to learn!
